Everybody knows what Flappy Bird is. The game I made is the same Flappy Bird that you are familiar with, but with one key difference.
ITS FLAPPY BIRD BUT IN NIGHT TIME!!
The tech stack I used was almost entirely JavaScript; I am currently learning the language.
This game can be played on either a touchscreen or keyboard; it's designed for phones and computers.
Some improvements could be made by adding music to the game, sound effects, and more visual variations.
